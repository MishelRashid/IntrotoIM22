# INITIAL PLAN

- I am fascinated in general by sensory inputs and outputs and my initial idea had to do with sensors which would make my switch on but this could not work due to 
- practical difficulties.
- I then thought a lot and then made use of a window. When the window opens, the circuit breaks and it stays that way until the window closes and the curcuit
- is completed and the LED light turns on again. 


# PROCESS

- I started off by finding the correct angle of the window, and where it would be possible to place the Arduino and the breadboard close to each other. 
- I chose the top left corner of the window.
- I taped the Arduino and the breadboard on the window.
- I then taped one wire near the opening of the window and another where I taped the breadboard.
- I connected and taped two wires together as this would make it easier for me to open the window all the way without disrupting my entire circuit.
- When the window opens, the angled wire moves away from the other wire connected and the circuit is seen to break and when the door close, the two wires 
- connect.

# ISSUES THAT I FACED

- One thing that I realize is that one might come up with a game plan initially and theorethically, but when it comes to making it work, it gets difficult 
- you can face a lot of issues. For me, I found it hard to angle the wires so they could work but I managed to do so. Another interesting this was to tape both
- of the wires to each other to make a longer wire and so the window could open all the way. The end result was satisfying and I played around it with quite a lot
- as I kept opening the window and closing it all the way.
