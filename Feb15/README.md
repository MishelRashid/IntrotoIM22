I used Object Oriented Programming for this assignment. I had a class for a person along with the methods to go along with it. The methods were responsible for making the person move across the screen.
Once the person hit the edge of the screen, I changed the direction. This proved to be a challenge at first as for some reason, the person would walk faster backwards but I ended up fixing it by testing the code (using a lower frame count)

What I learnt:
1.Lowering the frame count helps in finding exactly what went wrong in the code
2.Object oriented programming allows for methods which I could use to make the person move. 
3.Easy to add more objects using the same code instead of repeating the same code - make it easier.

I have uploaded a video demo of the program in this folder.

Here's a picture (static):
