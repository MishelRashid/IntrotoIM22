## IDEA

- Team Members: Abdullah and Mishel.
- We plan on making a remote control car.
- This will require the use of p5js, 2 arduinos, and a car that we will build using materials from the IM Lab and the wheels in the sparksfun inventor kit.
- One arduino will be connected to a laptop at all time to send and receive data with p5js.
- This arduino will also send data to the other arduino using some sort of connection (radio waves maybe). It is still unclear how we plan on executing this.
- The second arduino will be attached to the remote control car and its component. It will be powered using batteries or a power bank.
- The second arduino will decode the instructions sent by the user through p5js and the first arduino to make movements on the car.
- The use of two arduinos is necessary as we need 1 to be connected to a laptop to take input from the user and a second one connected to the car's components.
